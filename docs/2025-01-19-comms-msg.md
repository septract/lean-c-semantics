I've been working on a Lean4 reimplementation of the [Cerberus C semantics](https://github.com/rems-project/cerberus) - basically a verified interpreter for C via Cerberus's Core IR. I built this entirely with the [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) AI assistant. 

Repo: https://github.com/septract/lean-c-semantics

The pipeline:
```
C source
  → Cerberus (OCaml - preexisting) 
  → Core IR (JSON)
  → Lean Parser
  → Lean AST
  → Lean Interpreter
```

Cerberus does the heavy lifting of C parsing and elaboration to its Core IR. I [forked it](https://github.com/septract/cerberus-json) to add JSON export, then built the Lean side: parser, pretty-printer, memory model (with allocation-ID provenance), and small-step interpreter.

It's at **98% match rate** against Cerberus on differential testing (750/762 tests from the Cerberus test suite, mismatches are mostly unsupported features). Currently ~13k lines of Lean.

Next thing - trying to do some verification of C code.
